The project aims at detecting cracks on railway tracks.
An IR sensor is used to detect the crack also an Ultrasonic sensor is employed
to detect any obstucle if present in front of the vehicle.
Each time a crack is detected a buzzer sound will be heard and the detector
keeps moving, and when an obstucle is detected the buzzer sounds continuously and the  
vehicle stops.A 16x2 lcd display is also employed.2 controllers are used
an Arduino Nano and an ESP8266 which are asigned to  communicate serially.
All the sensors and lcd are connected to nano and esp is used to provide notification at the event of cracks
or obstacle and the current location of the detector using Blynk application.
